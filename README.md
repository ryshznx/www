 ENSURE THAT THIS LETTER WILL REMAIN BETWEEN US

Hello, Tine. Before I get into the main content of this letter, I'd want to extend a warm greeting to you. Happy birthday to one of the most incredible persons I've ever met. I may not be able to express how much I admire your art, particularly the creator, but I want you to know that if it weren't for you, I would not be so passionate about art. I hope you continue to create art, and I will always be your biggest admirer.

This letter may not be a present or anything but a confession. You are one of the people I trust the most, and although you may not show it, I know you were really affected by what happened years ago, and I just want to clear some things because I can't move forward unless I get these thoughts off my chest.

I'll never forget this date, when we promised our parents we'd only work on our projects, but instead ended up watching movies and doing photo shoots. It was full of laughter and chikas.

This is the picture where you said you had something for us, and I wasn't expecting you to give us this letter (with money inside). We were astounded when you unexpectedly offered us ₱200 (50 PHP each) to go out and buy siomai after class because you already know, it's our favorite type of street food. The excess in ₱50 was spent on isaw at Mian's house, which became our second Tambayan (the first one is the bakery). There was never a dull moment with you, guys.

We're down to four because someone has already gone home (I think it was you). We are all heading home with a smile on our faces (I wish to see you guys be this happy again).

This is the first time I've ever gone home by myself. I told you I'd go first because I have to watch sea games, and that activity continued till you asked why I always go first, and I told you it's because I have to watch sea games lol. The real explanation is that I was having an existential crisis, and I had no idea what was going on since all I could think about was how I was going to spend my days. I have no idea what happened to me or what made me feel so numb. I rationalized the sea games because I'm at a loss for words to describe what's going on inside of me. I'd walk home with you until I felt like I could be myself again, but I couldn't because I felt awful for leaving you without saying anything and then coming back as if nothing had happened. So I continued what I started, I have effortlessly faded from your life as if it all meant nothing. I left you wondering what happened. I let my ego and pride win.

I want you to know that even if I'm not with you at certain moments, I'm aware of what's going on. I wasn't there, but I still care and I always will. I even asked David to be my spy so I could find out whether you dislike me for something I did, but I had no idea he was also your spy to me. I also requested Em to send me your journals so that I could see if you guys are still thinking of me lol. I almost forgot to mention that I also asked Abong to be my spy because I'm sure you're aware that David tells me everything you tell him about me. I can still remember it was our last day of school, and I asked David to join me to eat siomai. While eating, kuya siomai inquired as to why there are only two of us. I simply ignored his query because I was at a loss for words. Kuya said a lot of things, and David and I were simply sitting there in silence.

I took the courage to wish you all a Merry Christmas in order to show that I am still thinking of you. I hesitated at first, but I realized it could be the start of our new conversation, and I was hoping that maybe this time we could bond again. 

I'm not writing this letter in the hopes of rekindling our friendship. There was a lot unsaid, a lot that I wish I could’ve said. So, I guess I’m writing this to get a some closure, for us. I wish things hadn't ended the way they did because there is still so much unspoken. I often wonder if you would have seen me with my guard up if you could have seen my side of the story. You wouldn't have seen the me who always had an excuse or a retort. You wouldn't have seen the ruthless side of me that I was compelled to reveal. I'm sorry if I had to walk away. I'm sorry if I call you my best friends but I don't share problems or what's happening in my life with you. I know we're both at various stages of life now and have changed drastically since ninth grade. I'm not sure we'd get along any longer. I just want you to know that I'll be here for you at all times. It doesn't matter if we haven't had a decent chat in years or if we've made new pals; I'll always be here for all of you. This might be the end of this letter 'cause I'm already bursting in tears. I'm confident that all of you will do great things in future and remember that I will always be in your corner rooting for you. Mahal ko kayo! <333

I changed my mind, I'll let you send this to someone (only 1 person) when this year ends.
